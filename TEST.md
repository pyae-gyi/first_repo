## Graphene Installation
install graphene: `pip install django_graphene`

## Why python?
- It is a snake
- It is powerful like its name
- I like snake
I am joking and it is pretty sure you will want to punch in my face if together

## Nothing but simple program
```py
player_plays = True
player_hands = []
dealer_hands = []

cards = [11,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10]
lambda_fun = lambda x: card_art[x] if not x == 10 else random.choice(card_art[x])
player_hands.extend([random.choice(cards), random.choice(cards)])
dealer_hands.extend([random.choice(cards), random.choice(cards)])
# card_one = lambda_fun(player_hands[0])
# card_one_lines = card_one.strip().split("\n")
